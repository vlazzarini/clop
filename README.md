A generic interface to the Open Computing Language for Csound

This repository attempts to provide an interface to OpenCL for Csound in the form of a suite of opcodes.
It is based on a C++ wrapper class that exposes the relevant OpenCL API functionality and CPOF (using the latest code from 
Csound 6.14 beta). At the moment, a couple of simple opcodes are given as a proof of concept. A more complete set will be 
developed as the project progresses.
